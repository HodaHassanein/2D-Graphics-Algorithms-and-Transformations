# 2D-Graphics-Algorithms-and-Transformations
This C# project implements 2D graphics algorithms (line drawing, circle/ellipse drawing) and transformations (translation, scaling, rotation, reflection, shearing). It provides efficient and accurate rendering of shapes and allows manipulation of objects in a 2D space.
